            Suppose we had a zero sum game with payoff matrix:
            <me>
                {{payoff}}
            </me>
        
            Find the optimal mixed strategy for both players for this game.  Then identify the vonNuemann 
            value of the game and state which player is favored.
        </p>

        <p>
            After domination the payoff matrix should look like: <me>{{domination}}</me> with row strategies
            {{r1strat}}, {{r2strat}} and {{r3strat}} remaining, and column strategies {{c1strat}}, {{c2strat}} and {{c3strat}} remaining.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since {{optimalsolution}} is a saddle point corresponding to row strategy {{ropt}} and
            column strategy {{copt}}, these are the optimal strategies for both players.  
            The vonNuemann value of the game is {{optimalsolution}}, so the game {{conclusion}}.
