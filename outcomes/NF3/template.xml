            Consider the following weighted network with labeled weights:  
        </p>
        <p><image
                source="assets/NF3/generated/{{__seed__}}/plot.png"
                description="Weighted network with labeled weights."/></p>
        <p>
            Apply Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to this network and find the shortest path from <m>v_s</m> to <m>v_d</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After applying the algorithm, we have:  
        </p>
        <p><image
                source="assets/NF3/generated/{{__seed__}}/plot2.png"
                description="Weighted network with labeled weights, and distances from the source."/></p>
        <p>
            The distance from <m>v_d</m> to <m>v_d</m> is <m>{{Dd}}</m>.  An example of such a path is 
            <m> v_s{{#ShortPath}}, v_{ {{i}} } {{/ShortPath}}    </m>. 
        </p>
