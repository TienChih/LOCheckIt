            Suppose we had five jobs to be done by five workers, each worker is to do exactly one job. The cost for job
             <m>i</m> to be done by worker <m>j</m> (in thousands of dollars) is encoded in the following matrix:
            <me>
                {{A}}
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the assignment algorithm to assign jobs to workers in a way that minimizes cost.

        <p>
            The minimal assignment cost may be achieved by assigning 
            {{#data}}
                  Job <m>{{W}}</m> to Worker <m>{{M}}</m>, 
            {{/data}}
            for total cost of <m>{{optimalsolution}}</m> thousand dollars (note that while this cost is unique, the specific assignment may not be).
