            Suppose that {{product1}} sells for $<m>{{c1}}</m> a unit and requires <m>{{a11}}</m> units of {{material1}}, 
            <m>{{a21}}</m> units of {{material2}}, <m>{{a31}}</m> units of {{material3}}, and <m>{{a41}}</m> units of {{material4}}.
            {{product2}} sells for $<m>{{c2}}</m> a unit and requires <m>{{a12}}</m> units of {{material1}}, 
            <m>{{a22}}</m> units of {{material2}}, <m>{{a32}}</m> units of {{material3}}, and <m>{{a42}}</m> units of {{material4}}.
            {{product3}} sells for $<m>{{c3}}</m> a unit and requires <m>{{a13}}</m> units of {{material1}}, 
            <m>{{a23}}</m> units of {{material2}}, <m>{{a33}}</m> units of {{material3}}, and <m>{{a43}}</m> units of {{material4}}.
            {{product4}} sells for $<m>{{c4}}</m> a unit and requires <m>{{a14}}</m> units of {{material1}}, 
            <m>{{a24}}</m> units of {{material2}}, <m>{{a34}}</m> units of {{material3}}, and <m>{{a44}}</m> units of {{material4}}.
            There are <m>{{b1}}</m> units of {{material1}}, <m>{{b2}}</m> units of {{material2}}, <m>{{b3}}</m> units of {{material3}},
            <m>{{b4}}</m> units of {{material4}}.  We wish to maximize revenue.  For each material, if one were to recieve one more unit of
            each material, how would that change the optimal revenue?

            The initial tableau should look like:
            <me>
                \begin{array}{|cccc|c|l}
                x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3 &amp; x_4 &amp; -1\\
                \hline
                {{a11}} &amp; {{a12}} &amp; {{a13}} &amp; {{a14}} &amp; {{b1}} &amp; = -t_1\\
                {{a21}} &amp; {{a22}} &amp; {{a23}} &amp; {{a24}} &amp; {{b2}} &amp; = -t_2\\
                {{a31}} &amp; {{a32}} &amp; {{a33}} &amp; {{a34}} &amp; {{b3}} &amp; = -t_3\\
                {{a41}} &amp; {{a42}} &amp; {{a43}} &amp; {{a44}} &amp; {{b4}} &amp; = -t_4\\
                \hline
                {{c1}} &amp; {{c2}} &amp; {{c3}} &amp; {{c4}} &amp; {{d}}\\
                \hline
                \end{array}
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            The final tableau should be something like:
            <me>
                \begin{array}{|cccc|c|l}
                {{x1}} &amp; {{x2}} &amp; {{x3}} &amp; {{x4}}  &amp; -1\\
                \hline
                {{Fa11}} &amp; {{Fa12}} &amp; {{Fa13}} &amp; {{Fa14}} &amp; {{Fb1}} &amp; = -{{t1}}\\
                {{Fa21}} &amp; {{Fa22}} &amp; {{Fa23}} &amp; {{Fa24}} &amp; {{Fb2}} &amp; = -{{t2}}\\
                {{Fa31}} &amp; {{Fa32}} &amp; {{Fa33}} &amp; {{Fa34}} &amp; {{Fb3}} &amp; = -{{t3}}\\
                {{Fa41}} &amp; {{Fa42}} &amp; {{Fa43}} &amp; {{Fa44}} &amp; {{Fb4}} &amp; = -{{t4}}\\
                \hline
                {{Fc1}} &amp; {{Fc2}} &amp; {{Fc3}} &amp; {{Fc4}} &amp; {{Fd}}\\
                \hline
                \end{array}
            </me>
            Increasing the quantity of {{material1}} by one unit would increase the maximum revenue by <m>{{y1value}}</m> dollars.
            Increasing the quantity of {{material2}} by one unit would increase the maximum revenue by <m>{{y2value}}</m> dollars.
            Increasing the quantity of {{material3}} by one unit would increase the maximum revenue by <m>{{y3value}}</m> dollars.
            Increasing the quantity of {{material4}} by one unit would increase the maximum revenue by <m>{{y4value}}</m> dollars.
