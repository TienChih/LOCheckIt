                Rowan and Collen each put $<m>{{pool}}</m> into the pot.  Then 4 Jacks, 4 Queens and 4 Kings are shuffled, and then one card each is dealt to Rowan and Colleen.  They may each see their own card but not their opponents.
                Rowan may either <em>Fold</em>, in which case Colleen takes the entire pot, or they may <em>Raise</em> by $<m>{{bet}}</m>, putting this value into the pot.  If Rowan raises, then either Colleen <em>Fold</em>s, in which case Rowan takes the pot, or <em>Calls</em>, also placing
                $<m>{{bet}}</m> into the pot.  If Colleen calls, both player reveals their cards, and the player with the higher card (with Jack &lt; Queen &lt; King) takes the pot. In the case of a tie they split the pot.

                Rowan and Collen each put $<m>{{pool}}</m> into the pot.  They then each flip two coins in secret and count the number of heads.
                Rowan may either <em>Fold</em>, in which case Colleen takes the entire pot, or they may <em>Raise</em> by $<m>{{bet}}</m>, putting this value into the pot.  If Rowan raises, then either Colleen <em>Fold</em>s, in which case Rowan takes the pot, or <em>Calls</em>, also placing

                Rowan and Collen each put $<m>{{pool}}</m> into the pot.  They then each roll a four-sided dice in secret.
                Rowan may either <em>Fold</em>, in which case Colleen takes the entire pot, or they may <em>Raise</em> by $<m>{{bet}}</m>, putting this value into the pot.  If Rowan raises, then either Colleen <em>Fold</em>s, in which case Rowan takes the pot, or <em>Calls</em>, also placing
                $<m>{{bet}}</m> into the pot.  If Colleen calls, both player reveals their die, and the player with the higher number takes the pot. In the case of a tie they split the pot.
