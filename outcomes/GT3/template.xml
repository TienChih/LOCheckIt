                Rowan and Colleen are playing a card game together.  
                Rowan is dealt a {{rn1}} of {{rsuit1}}, {{rn2}} of {{rsuit2}}, {{rn3}} of {{rsuit3}}, and a {{rn4}} of {{rsuit4}}.
                Colleen is dealt a {{cn1}} of {{csuit1}}, {{cn2}} of {{csuit2}}, {{cn3}} of {{csuit3}}, and a {{cn4}} of {{csuit4}}.
                Each player picks a card in secret and places it face down on the table, then they flip them over at the same time.
                If they suits are the same, Rowan wins points equal to the sum of the card values.  
                Otherwise, Colleen wins points equal to the sum of the card values.

                Each player Rowan and Colleen selects  a number from <m>1</m> through <m>{{n}}</m> and reveals them at the same time.
                If the difference between selections is less than <m>{{m}}</m>, the player with the larger number wins points
                equal to the sum of the selections.
                Otherwise the player with the smaller number wins points
                equal to the sum of the selections.
                If the selections are equal, neither player wins any points.

                Colonel Rowan is attacking a town defended by Colonel Colleen. 
                Rowan has <m>{{Rtroop}}</m> regiments and Colleen has <m>{{Ctroop}}</m>. 
                There are two routes to the town. 
                Rowan and select any number of regiments to attack along each route, up to a total of <m>{{Rtroop}}</m>
                 and Colleen can likewise assign her <m>{{Ctroop}}</m> regiments along either route, neither knowing beforehand the other's strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along each route, whatever side has a greater number of regiments wins points equal to the 
                number of regiments sent by the opposing side (as they capture those units). 
                Furthermore, if Rowan wins along either route, he captures the town also worth one point.

                If they are the same, Rowan pays Colleen a number of dollars equal to the sum of the selections.
