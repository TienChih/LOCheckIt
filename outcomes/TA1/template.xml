            Suppose we had four warehouses with <m>{{W1}}, {{W2}}, {{W3}}, {{W4}} </m> {{good}}s each, and
            four markets who require <m>{{M1}}, {{M2}}, {{M3}}, {{M4}} </m> {{good}}s each. The cost to ship from
            Warehouse <m>i</m> to Market <m>j</m> is encoded in the following matrix:
            <me>
                {{A}}
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Encode this problem in a transportation tableau and use the transportation algorithm to find the 
            shipping schedule which minimizes cost.

            The initial tableau should look like:
            <me>
                \begin{array}{|cccc|c}
                \hline
                {{a11}} &amp; {{a12}} &amp; {{a13}} &amp; {{a14}} &amp; {{W1}} \\
                {{a21}} &amp; {{a22}} &amp; {{a23}} &amp; {{a24}} &amp; {{W2}} \\
                {{a31}} &amp; {{a32}} &amp; {{a33}} &amp; {{a34}} &amp; {{W3}} \\
                {{a41}} &amp; {{a42}} &amp; {{a43}} &amp; {{a44}} &amp; {{W4}} \\
                \hline
                {{M1}} &amp; {{M2}} &amp; {{M3}} &amp; {{M4}} &amp; {{total}}
                \end{array}
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            The minimal shipping cost may be achieved by shipping 
            {{#data}}
                  <m>{{Q}}</m> {{good}}s from Warehouse <m>{{W}}</m> to Market <m>{{M}}</m>, 
            {{/data}}
            for total cost of $<m>{{optimalsolution}}</m> (note that while this cost is unique, the shipping quantities may not be).
