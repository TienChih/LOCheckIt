            A rental service needs to purchase {{good}}s to be rented for the next 4 days.
            The demand for {{good}}s for these days are <m>{{M1}}, {{M2}}, {{M3}}, {{M4}}</m> each.  It costs
            <m>{{newcost}}</m> credits to purchase them new.  
            It costs <m>{{slowcost}}</m> credits to fix them up for use again after a full day of work.  This can be speed
            up for <m>{{fastcost}}</m> credits to be ready the very next day.  How many new {{good}}s
            should be purchased, and how many after each day should be fast fixed or slow fixed to minimize cost?

            <m>{{purchase}}</m> {{good}}s should be purchased new.  
            After the first day, <m>{{day1fast}}</m> should be fast fixed, and <m>{{day1slow}}</m> should be slow fixed.  
            After the second day, <m>{{day2fast}}</m> should be fast fixed, and <m>{{day2slow}}</m> should be slow fixed.  
            After the third day, <m>{{day3fast}}</m> should be fast fixed.  
            This results in a minimal cost of <m>{{optimalsolution}}</m> credits.
