        <p>
            Consider the <m>(c,w)</m> pairs the cost and weight respectively. Find a feasible flow from <m>v_s</m> to <m>v_d</m> through this network of value <m>F = {{flow}}</m> which minimizes the weight of the flow.

        <p>
            The minimum weight is <m>{{optimalsolution}}</m>.  An example of such a flow is 
            <m>z_{s,1} = {{zs1}}</m>,
            <m>z_{s,2} = {{zs2}}</m>,
            <m>z_{1,2} = {{z12}}</m>,
            <m>z_{2,1} = {{z21}}</m>,
            <m>z_{1,3} = {{z13}}</m>,
            <m>z_{3,1} = {{z31}}</m>,
            <m>z_{1,4} = {{z14}}</m>,
            <m>z_{4,1} = {{z41}}</m>,
            <m>z_{2,3} = {{z23}}</m>,
            <m>z_{3,2} = {{z32}}</m>,
            <m>z_{2,4} = {{z24}}</m>,
